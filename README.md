The moment I got "Hello World!" to appear in the console, I knew that
very moment that this has been my calling. <br>Web development is not
something I see as 'just a job', it's something that engages me to be
creative and <br>to bring that creativity out for others to experience. I
just want to keep learning and improve my skills<br> by collaborating with others in this industry!
